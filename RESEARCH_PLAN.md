# AI-Powered Conversational Agents for E-Commerce: Research Plan

## 🎯 **Refined Research Question** (Based on Professor's Feedback)

**"How do domain-specific prompting techniques and lightweight ML algorithms compare to general-purpose LLMs in e-commerce conversational agents for product discovery, recommendations, and purchase support?"**

---

## 🔬 **Research Methodology: Three-Approach Comparison**

### **Approach 1: Advanced LLM Prompting (No Fine-tuning)**

Following professor's guidance, use sophisticated prompting instead of expensive fine-tuning:

#### **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

```
You are an expert e-commerce assistant. For each user query, think step-by-step:

1. UNDERSTAND: What is the user's core need?
   - Primary use case
   - Budget constraints
   - Specific requirements

2. CATEGORIZE: What product categories match?
   - Main category
   - Related subcategories

3. FILTER: What criteria matter most?
   - Must-have features
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Deal-breakers

4. RANK: How to prioritize results?
   - Price vs quality balance
   - Brand preferences
   - Reviews/ratings

User: "I need running shoes for flat feet under $120"
Think through each step, then provide recommendations.
```

#### **Few-Shot Learning with Domain Examples**

```
You are a personal shopping expert. Here are examples of excellent recommendations:

Example 1:
User: "Laptop for college, $800 budget, needs to last 4 years"
Analysis: Student prioritizes durability over gaming performance
Recommendation: "ThinkPad E15 ($750) - Business durability, 3yr warranty, excellent typing"

Example 2:
User: "Running shoes for flat feet, daily 5K, under $120"
Analysis: Daily runner + specific condition + budget constraint
Recommendation: "ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite ($110) - Motion control for flat feet"

Now help: [User Query]
```

#### **Multi-Agent Prompting System**

```python
class EcommerceAgentSystem:
    agents = {
        'search_agent': "You specialize in product discovery...",
        'recommendation_agent': "You focus on personalized suggestions...",
        'support_agent': "You handle comparisons and questions...",
        'cart_agent': "You manage cart operations..."
    }

    def route_query(self, user_message):
        intent = classify_intent(user_message)
        return self.agents[intent].process(user_message)
```

### **Approach 2: Domain-Specific Lightweight ML (Cost-Effective)**

Build custom algorithms without expensive model training:

#### **A. Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Engine**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD

class CollaborativeFilter:
    def __init__(self, n_components=50):
        self.svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=n_components)
        self.user_item_matrix = None

    def fit(self, interactions_df):
        # Build sparse user-item matrix from purchase/view history
        self.user_item_matrix = self.build_matrix(interactions_df)
        # Matrix factorization for scalable recommendations
        self.user_factors = self.svd.fit_transform(self.user_item_matrix)
        self.item_factors = self.svd.components_

    def recommend(self, user_id, n_items=5):
        # Find similar users based on purchase patterns
        user_vector = self.user_factors[user_id]
        scores = np.dot(user_vector, self.item_factors)
        return np.argsort(scores)[-n_items:][::-1]
```

#### **B. Content-Based Product Matching**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class ContentBasedMatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
        self.product_vectors = None

    def build_index(self, products_df):
        # Combine title, description, category, brand
        text_features = products_df['title'] + ' ' + products_df['description'] + ' ' + products_df['category']
        self.product_vectors = self.tfidf.fit_transform(text_features)

    def find_similar(self, query, top_k=10):
        query_vector = self.tfidf.transform([query])
        similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, self.product_vectors)[0]
        return np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]
```

#### **C. Rule-Based Intent Classification**

```python
import re

class IntentClassifier:
    patterns = {
        'SEARCH': [r'\b(find|looking for|show me|need|want)\b', r'\b(search|browse)\b'],
        'COMPARE': [r'\b(vs|versus|compare|difference|better|which)\b'],
        'RECOMMEND': [r'\b(suggest|recommend|best|good|popular)\b'],
        'CART': [r'\b(add|buy|purchase|cart|checkout)\b'],
        'PRICE': [r'\$\d+|under \d+|budget|cheap|expensive|cost'],
    }

    def classify(self, text):
        text_lower = text.lower()
        scores = {}

        for intent, patterns in self.patterns.items():
            score = sum(len(re.findall(pattern, text_lower)) for pattern in patterns)
            scores[intent] = score

        return max(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0] if max(scores.values()) > 0 else 'GENERAL'
```

#### **D. Hybrid Search Algorithm**

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

class HybridSearchEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content_matcher = ContentBasedMatcher()
        self.semantic_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Lightweight
        self.product_embeddings = None

    def search(self, query, filters=None):
        # 1. Keyword-based search (fast)
        keyword_results = self.content_matcher.find_similar(query, top_k=50)

        # 2. Semantic search (accurate)
        query_embedding = self.semantic_model.encode([query])
        semantic_similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, self.product_embeddings)[0]
        semantic_results = np.argsort(semantic_similarities)[-20:][::-1]

        # 3. Combine and rank
        combined_scores = self.combine_rankings(keyword_results, semantic_results)
        return self.apply_filters(combined_scores, filters)
```

### **Approach 3: Hybrid System (Smart Routing)**

Combine both approaches strategically:

```python
class HybridEcommerceAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm_system = LLMPromptingSystem()
        self.ml_system = DomainSpecificMLSystem()

    def process_query(self, user_query, context):
        # Route based on query complexity and requirements
        if self.requires_reasoning(user_query):
            return self.llm_system.process(user_query, context)
        elif self.is_simple_search(user_query):
            return self.ml_system.process(user_query, context)
        else:
            # Use ML for initial filtering, LLM for final recommendations
            candidates = self.ml_system.get_candidates(user_query, n=20)
            return self.llm_system.rank_and_explain(candidates, user_query, context)
```

    }

    for query, expected_items in zip(test_queries, ground_truth):
        recommendations = system.recommend(query, k=10)

        # Calculate precision@k, recall@k, NDCG@k
        precision = len(set(recommendations[:k]) & set(expected_items)) / k
        recall = len(set(recommendations[:k]) & set(expected_items)) / len(expected_items)

        metrics['precision_at_k'].append(precision)
